The First Fantasy is a text-based role-playing game developed completely with Python for use in a console window. In the game, you can travel around the world, fighting enemies to gain experience, gold, and loot to improve your character. A clear goal is yet to be defined, but the challenge of progressing farther away from your starting area provides incentive to play.
